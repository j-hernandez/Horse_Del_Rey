# Horse_Del_Rey
Markov tweet generator using Lana Del Rey lyrics. 

The order needed to run this is 
1) scrape_lyrics.py
2) generate_markov_dictionary.py
3) tweet_generator.py
4) send_tweet.py (add your API key and token to the template)

I did this as a way to learn some python and markov chains(which are super interesting, seriously go read up on them)
